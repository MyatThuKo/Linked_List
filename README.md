# Linked_List
<h2>Data Structure C++ (Linked List)</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Implement a transaction-based linked list data structure using C++. The program will be interactive. 
Data transactions will be entered at the command line and results will be displayed on the console. 
</li>
<li>
An alphabetized linked list of names and ages will be created, updated and managed using Add, Delete and List transactions.
These transaction types will be processed as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Add – To add a name to the list, enter a transaction in the form of “A”, space, name (no spaces in the name), space, age. 
For example: “A John 28”. If the new name is not on the list, the name and age will be added such that the list of names is in ascending alphabetical order and the message “name added” will be displayed. 
If the name is already on the list, the name will not be added, and the message “name not added” will be displayed.
</li>
<li>
Delete – To delete a name and age from the list, enter a transaction in the form of “D”, space, name (no spaces in the name). 
For example: “D Joan”. If the name is not on the list, the message “name not found” will be displayed. 
If the name is on the list, the name and age will be removed and the message “name deleted” will be displayed. 
</li>
<li> 
List – To display the names in ascending sequence, enter a transaction in the form “L”.
Each name in the list will be displayed with the respective age on a line by itself.
</li>
<li>
Reverse List – To display the names in desending sequence, enter a transaction in the form “R”.
Each name in the list will be displayed with the respective age on a line by itself.
</li>
</li>
<li>
Quit – To terminate the program, enter a transaction in the form of “Q”.
</li>
</ol>
